<h1>PyAUTO</h1>
<p1>PyAUTO is a free,open-source, online system that will check your Python3 code's style and paradigm.
This is going to be very useful for Python3 tutors. The code is in Python3. It will first be an offline application,
and then we will try to figure out how to build it to a web-based system, maybe using some Javascript.<br><br></p1>
